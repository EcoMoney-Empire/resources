# Contributing

Skriptify has a strong connection with its community. With this being said, we allow user-created scripts to be added to the resource list on our website @ https://skriptify.xyz/scripts It is very important that you read this entire post before contributing, or you risk getting your resource denied.

## INFO

- You don't necessarily have to remake a plugin. You can make anything you feel is essential/needed on a server.
- The Top Contributors discord role is granted to users who have many resources on the site. (Posts you make in #contribute don't count. This is judged by accepted resources which are on the website.)

## GUIDELINES

- Do not repost, redistribute, or claim anything as your own.
- You may not post someone else's resource and claim it as your own.
- Resources in #contribute must be submitted by the author.

### NOTES

- Make sure to include all contributors for creator.
- For 'raw link', put a link to your raw script code. i.e. a raw pastebin link, or a raw github link.
- For 'Addons required', if there are no addons, put None.
- Description MUST be 4 sentences minimum.
- For updating or new, specify whether you are updating a previous plugin, or making a new one

## DENIED RESOURCES

Resources are denied because of;

1.
- Your script is a duplicate, repost, or redistribution.
- Your script could not function.
- Script is completely useless.

2. (Only used in cases where the functions/features of your script are part of a much larger script that's already approved.)
- It could lack content/features.
- It's code could be too short. 

3.
- Format not followed.
- Description could be too short. (Minimum 4 sentences)
